## Proxy 

Provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

A web server such as Nginx can act as a proxy for your application server:

It provides controlled access to your application server.
It can do rate limiting.
It can do request caching.
